HEY

My name is Acacia, Welcome to my Github! 


[BIO]
-----
This is a place I can publish my code from various types of projects, ones that I am not super embarrassed about at least. I am in no way a
professional software engineer nor developer, just an autistic guy that has loved coding from a young age. I mainly focus on this relating to web 
development and Video games, for example ComputerCraft and my portfolio website (Which can be found on my linktree). In the future I plan on expanding
my knowledge base into other languages but for now im sticking with C#, Lua, HTML and CSS

[CODE]
-----
For years now i have loved coding, I started with lua, after my brother got me hooked on programming turtle and computers in minecraft. After i consumed
content and read books based on different languages, I decided for years I'd settle on HTML and CSS. I't had been a long running dream of mine to create
my own portfolio website to share my info and to allow people to have a unique and hand crafted way of seeing my work and some other hobbies i work on.
That isnt the extent of my journey, I've dabbled in a bunch of other languages such as C#, ruby, python and javascript, some of which are avavilable to
view here.

Thanks for visiting my page and checking out my projects,

Note this isnt actively kept up with and I dont publish all of my projects and work, treat this as a dumping ground for my longer standing and more
permanent projects i wish to maintain :)
